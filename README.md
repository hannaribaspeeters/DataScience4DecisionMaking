# Building a Robot Judge: Data Science for Decision-Making (ETH Zürich - Fall 2022)

This repository contains my completed assignments for the course "Building a Robot Judge: Data Science for Decision-Making", taught by Prof. Elliott Ash at ETH Zürich in Fall 2022. The course explores the use of data science tools to analyze and support expert decision-making, with a focus on fairness, justice, and bias in automated systems.

## Course Objectives:
- Implement and evaluate machine learning pipelines.
- Implement and evaluate causal inference designs.
- Assess research and systems using algorithms for decision-making.
